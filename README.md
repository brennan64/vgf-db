  User can create an account to see and interact with a database of video game foods. We wanted to make a list of some of our favorite dishes from our favorite games so that others can go through and share their own. User is able to post new dishes into our database if there's something we don't have on the list! Can search for all information about foods,or just seeing categories of the food. User can see posts that they've created on the site.
